Fake currency circulation is a serious problem that affects financial systems worldwide. Traditional manual methods of detecting counterfeit notes are slow and error-prone. 
This project leverages Machine Learning (ML) to detect fake currency notes automatically based on their features.
We use statistical properties of banknotes such as variance, skewness, kurtosis of wavelet-transformed images, and entropy to classify whether a currency note is genuine or fake.
